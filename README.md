# VariationalBayesLinearRegressionSpike-and-Slab

My attempt to implement variational bayes for linear regression using spike and slab priors. It may be helpful to look at the code alongside the equations included in the pdf. I'm sure the code could be written in a more efficient and vectorized way, but I mostly did it this way to be instructive for myself.
