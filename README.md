# VariationalBayesLinearRegressionSpike-and-Slab

My attempt to implement variational bayes for linear regression using spike and slab priors. It may be helpful to look at the code alongside the equations. I'm sure it could be written in a more efficient and vectorized way, but I mostly did it this was to be instructive for myself.
